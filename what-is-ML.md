### What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning** is a branch of Artificial Intelligence where a computer **learns from data** and **improves its performance automatically** without being explicitly programmed for every rule.

👉 Instead of *“if–else rules”*, we give the system **data + patterns**, and it figures things out.

## 🧠 Core Idea (Simple)

> **Data → Learning → Prediction/Decision**

Example:

* You show many house details (size, location, price)
* ML learns the relationship
* It predicts price for a new house

---

## 🔑 Key Components of Machine Learning

### 1️⃣ Data

* Input given to the model
* Can be:

  * Numbers (marks, salary)
  * Text (reviews)
  * Images (faces)
  * Videos, audio, etc.

---

### 2️⃣ Features

* Important pieces of data used for learning
* Example (House Price):

  * Size
  * Number of rooms
  * Location

---

### 3️⃣ Model

* A **mathematical function** that learns patterns
* Examples:

  * Linear Regression
  * Decision Tree
  * Neural Network

---

### 4️⃣ Training

* The model **learns from historical data**
* Adjusts itself to reduce errors

---

### 5️⃣ Prediction / Inference

* The trained model is used on **new, unseen data**

## 📚 Types of Machine Learning

### 🔹 1. Supervised Learning

✔ Data has **inputs + correct output (labels)**

Examples:

* Email → Spam / Not Spam
* House → Price

Algorithms:

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* SVM

---

### 🔹 2. Unsupervised Learning

✔ **No labels**, model finds patterns itself

Examples:

* Customer segmentation
* Grouping similar users

Algorithms:

* K-Means Clustering
* Hierarchical Clustering
* PCA

---

### 🔹 3. Reinforcement Learning

✔ Learning by **trial and error**

Examples:

* Game playing AI
* Robot movement
* Self-driving cars

Key terms:

* Agent
* Reward
* Environment

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow

1. Collect Data
2. Clean & preprocess data
3. Select features
4. Choose algorithm
5. Train model
6. Evaluate performance
7. Deploy model

## 📊 How Do We Measure Performance?

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* RMSE (for regression)

---

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

* Recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon)
* Fraud detection
* Face recognition
* Medical diagnosis
* Stock price prediction
* Chatbots & virtual assistants

## 🆚 ML vs Traditional Programming

| Traditional Programming | Machine Learning      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Rules + Data → Output   | Data + Output → Rules |
| Fixed logic             | Learns patterns       |
| Manual updates          | Self-improving        |
